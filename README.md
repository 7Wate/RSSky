> Infinite possibilities, born for freedom

## Introduction

In the era of information overload, algorithmic recommendations often trap users in an "information cocoon," limiting their exposure to diverse perspectives. **RSSky** is an open-source project designed to break these barriers by providing users with access to a wide range of information sources. Leveraging RSS technology and community collaboration, RSSky offers high-quality, comprehensive content subscription services to help users enhance their understanding of the world and improve their ability to discern information.

The project is driven by the power of community, utilizing Cloudflare Workers to proxy and cache RSS resources. It also employs a GitHub open-source repository to manage and verify subscriptions, ensuring content is both timely and efficient.

## Features

- **Open Access to Information**: Provides a rich array of RSS subscription resources, breaking the information cocoon.
- **Community Collaboration**: Community members can contribute, manage, and proxy RSS feeds through the GitHub repository.
- **Automated Management**: Utilizes GitHub Actions for automated updates and verification of RSS resources, ensuring content is always up-to-date.
